= Testing policy for MAdeK =

- Whenever a new feature is implemented, it must be accompanied by
  tests.

- We prefer tests in the following order:
  
  1. Rspec specifications (also used as unit tests)
  2. Cucumber feature tests
  3. Cucumber examples (as in Specification by Example)

- Rspec tests are to be preferred over higher-level tests.

- If you touch it, test it: Whenever someone changes something that
  had no test before, that person needs to write a test for it.

- UI integration tests are done when there is a high chance of
  regression.
