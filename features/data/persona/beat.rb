# == Biography
#
# Beat likes going to concerts and doing amateur photography. He has a good eye
# for photographic quality, that's why he is part of a team choosing the photo-
# graphs that are printed in each issue of the organization's in-house magazine.
#
# He doesn't like technology very much and would prefer an analog workflow. Since
# he doesn't spend too much time on the web, most user interface standards from
# popular web applications aren't known to him.
#
# During his work, he mostly has to do with photographers. His position is
# between photography and layout, preparing the right photos for layouters
# to use.
# 
# == Goals
#
# 1. Picking the best photos for ten different magazine articles each month.
# 2. Quickly getting an overview of the photos submitted by photographers.
# 3. Assembling photographs into different sets, one set per issue of the maga-
#    zine, one set for each article in each set.
#
# == Frustrations
#
# 1. Not finding the photographers' work in the system.
# 2. Getting confused about how to handle the system.
