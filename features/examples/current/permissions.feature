Feature: Permissions
  As a user
  I want to have different permissions on resources
  So that I can decide who has what kind of access to my data

  Background: Load the example data and personas
	Given I have set up the world
    And personas are loaded

  @javascript
  Scenario: View permission
    Given a resource
      And I am "Normin"
      And the resource has the following permissions:
      |user              |permission       |value|
      |Normin            |view             |true |
     Then "Normin" can view the resource

  @javascript
  Scenario: Edit permission
    Given a resource
      And I am "Normin"
      And the resource has the following permissions:
      |user              |permission       |value|
      |Normin            |edit             |true |
     Then "Normin" can edit the resource

  @javascript
  Scenario: Download original permission
    Given a resource
      And I am "Normin"
      And the resource has the following permissions:
      |user              |permission       |value|
      |Normin            |download         |true |
     Then "Normin" can download the resource
     
  @javascript
  Scenario: Manage permission
    Given a resource
      And I am "Normin"
      And the resource has the following permissions:
      |user              |permission       |value|
      |Normin            |manage           |true |
     Then "Normin" can manage the resource

  @javascript
  Scenario: Owner permission
    Given a resource
      And I am "Normin"
     Then "Normin" is the owner of the resource
  
  @javascript
  Scenario: Permission which allows a user to add MediaResources to a MediaSet  
    Given a set named "Editable Set"
      And I am "Normin"
      And the resource has the following permissions:
      |user              |permission       |value|
      |Normin            |edit             |true |
      And a set named "Viewable Set"
      And the resource has the following permissions:
      |user              |permission       |value|
      |Normin            |view             |true |
     When "Normin" adds the set "Viewable Set" to the set "Editable Set"
     Then "Viewable Set" is in "Editable Set"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Permissions through groups
  # Petra and Normin are members of the ZHdK Group.
  # Normin's Diplomarbeit (Set) is viewable by Petra, because Normin granted view permissions
  # for the ZHdK Group and Petra is member of that group. 
    Given I am "Petra"
      And I can view "Diplomarbeit 2012" by "Normin"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Users with explicit user permissions are explicitly excluded even when they would have group permissions
    # Petra and Normin are members of the ZHdK Group.
    # Normin's MediaSet "Meine Highlights 2012" is viewable by the ZHdK Group,
    # but he excluded Petra with explicit UserPermissions,
    # because he discovered that she is copy pasting his images from there to share them with others
    Given I am "Petra"
      And I can not view "Meine Highlights 2012" by "Normin"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Permission presets
    Given I am "Normin"
     When I open one of my resources
      And I open the permission lightbox
     Then I can choose from a set of labeled permissions presets instead of grant permissions explicitly

    Given a group "Some People" with the members:
    |member|

    |Person B|
    When I edit the permissions of a media entry
