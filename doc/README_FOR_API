## Introduction
This documentation describes the API for the MAdeK media archive system. It is aimed at programmers and anyone interested in interacting with a specific MAdeK instance. Every time a new version of MAdeK is released, the API docs suitable for that version are installed under /api in your MAdeK instance.

If you are a non-programmer and looking for instructions for installing your own MAdeK instance, general user documentation or system administrator documentation, please see the {http://github.com/zhdk/madek/wiki MAdeK wiki at GitHub} instead.

## Quick Examples
### List of the most recent MediaEntries
    /media_resources.json?with[type]=media_entry
This returns a list of the most recently edited MediaEntries of MAdeK - limited to 36 entries (pagination).

## JSON as Standard Format
Our standard format for the API is JSON. To communicate to the API you have to set the format explicitly on each request.  
### How to send JSON-Requests
    /media_resources.json
    /media_resources (with Header: "Accept: application/json")
