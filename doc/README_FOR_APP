= MADEK

==3rd party library (not gem nor plugin) requirements:

	- exiftool (http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)
	a platform independent Perl library/CLI for reading, writing and editing meta information in image, audio and video files.
	NB: this library is really regularly updated. There is potential benefit in keeping it up to date, either by hand or automatically (cron job?)

	- imageMagick
	a platform independent tool for image manipulation. At present we mainly use 'convert'. Should be relatively trivial to replace with another tool to do image conversion.
	
	- GraphViz (www.graphviz.org)
	a graphing library. At present we use 'dot' which allows hierarchical drawings of directed graphs.

----------------------------------------------

= Current general startup method:

Make sure sphinx search daemon is running: 

rake ts:conf (in case it's not configured)
rake ts:start


a handy reset task is provided:

rake madek:reset - will reset the database, set up various meta-data contexts and index the empty db

Note: Bug?
	When making a new deployment, make sure to stop the sphinx server, index and then start it again.
	Problem seems to be that we can have sphinx processes hanging around, which then point to the old releases index, 
	but are working on behalf of the new deployment - chances are very high that this will not work.
	
	Probably need to fix in capistrano.. (fix in place, soon to test?)
