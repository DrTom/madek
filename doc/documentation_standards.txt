#= Session
#
#  As mentioned throughout the CLI documentation, an interactive Shard
#  session can be invoked via the command line by simply executing index.rb
#  at this point all modules of the type 'cli' are loaded, among with regular
#  modules to provide their functionality. Each cli module may register hook::cli
#  which allows it to regsiter commands. 
#
#  === Invokes hook::cli
#  Each hook implementation should return an array of hashes, which register
#  commands to the CLI::Session.
#
#==== Required attributes 
#  - title:       Title of command
#  - description: Description of command
#  - callback:    Callback when pattern is matched
#
#[cat] a label for some text
#[ant] another label for some other text
#cat:: a small domestic animal
#+cat+:: a command to copy standard input
#
#==== Example implementation
#    def cli
#     [
#       {
#         :title => 'Help',
#         :description => 'Output command help and usage information.',
#         :pattern => /^[\s]*help/,
#         :syntax => 'help',
#         :callback => 'self.usage',
#       }
#     ]
#    end
