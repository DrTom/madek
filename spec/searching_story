Story: Searching Media Entries
	As a User
	I want to search MAdeK for images of the Tower of Pisa
	In order to use the media for some project I am working on


Scenario: Student uses "Quick-search"

	Given a User is logged in
	And the User is on a MAdeK search page
	
	When the User types "Pisa" and "Tower" in the quick-search box and clicks "search"
	
	Then the results returned should be images of the Tower of Pisa


Scenario: Student makes selection from search result

	Given a User is logged in
	And	has a search-result set of images of the Tower of Pisa
	And has an empty group called "Leaning Tower of Pisa"
	
	When the User selects a picture of the Tower of Pisa and moves it to the group
	
	Then the collection set "Leaning Tower of Pisa" will contain the picture
	
	(is "group" the right word? It implies group of users, maybe collection or set would be better?
	However if it *is* the latter, then how does this conflict with the saving own group scenario below?)


Scenario: Student limits the search results

	Given a User is logged in
	And has a search-result set of images of the Tower of Pisa

	When the User selects the filter/facet "TIF"

	Then only TIF format images will be shown in the results


Scenario: Student limits the search results

	Given a User is logged in
	And has a search-result set of images of the Tower of Pisa
	
	When the User enters some filter-text in the free-text filter form-box
	
	Then the search-result entries will be filtered accordingly


Scenario: User saves/stores their own group

	Given a User is logged in
	And has a search-result set of images of the Tower of Pisa
	
	When the User clicks the "save results" button and types "TofP"
	
	Then the search results are stored in an object called "TofP"

(This one is interesting - are we storing the results, or the query? Smart queries?)
